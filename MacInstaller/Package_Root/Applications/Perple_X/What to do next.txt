What to do next
===============

You have just made a new folder with copies of:
- hp02ver.dat, a datafile of thermodynamic parameters based on Holland
    and Powell's dataset.
- newest_format_solut.dat, a datafile with all the current Perplex-enabled
    solution models
- perplex_options.dat, a text file with a set of program options for
    Perplex, focused primarily on calculations
- perplex_plot_options.dat, a text file with a set of program options for
    Perplex, focused primarily of production of graphical documents
- OpenTerminalWindowHere - a useful script (see below)
- An alias to the Getting Started tutorial document
- (this document)
    
You should now run the script called "Open Terminal Window Here".  This will
    (strangely enough) open a new Terminal window, with the working directory
    set to this directory.  Once there, you can run Perplex by typing:

            build

If you would like to remove this file from future Perplex folders, you can
    just edit the applescript called MakePerplexFolder (drag it onto the
    AppleScript Editor program, located in /Applications/Utilities).  The
    applescript is likely located in /Applications/Perple_X.

If you would like to use a different thermodynamic database or change
    the solution models, you should:
    - download new datafiles from the Perplex website and put them in the
      datafiles folder within the PerpleX folder (whose default install
      location is /Applications)
    - edit the MakePerplexFolder applescript to copy different files to the
      directory it creates

If you are not sure what this whole Perplex thing is all about, try running
    through the "Getting Started" tutorial.  There is a link to it in this
    folder.
