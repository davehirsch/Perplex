What to do next
===============

You have just made a new folder with copies of:
- hp02ver.dat, a datafile of thermodynamic parameters based on Holland
    and Powell's dataset.
- newest_format_solut.dat, a datafile with all the current Perplex-enabled
    solution models
- perplex_options.dat, a text file with a set of program options for
    Perplex, focused primarily on calculations
- perplex_plot_options.dat, a text file with a set of program options for
    Perplex, focused primarily of production of graphical documents
- OpenCommandWindowHere.vbs - a useful script (see below)
- (this document)
    
You should now run the script called "OpenCommandWindowHere".  This will
    (strangely enough) open a new command window, with the working directory
    set to this directory.  Once there, you can run Perplex by typing:

            build

If you would like to remove this file from future Perplex folders, you can
    just edit the script called MakePerplexFolder.vbs.  It is likely located
    in C:\Program Files\PerpleX

If you would like to use a different thermodynamic database or change
    the solution models, you should:
    - download new datafiles from the Perplex website and put them in the
      datafiles folder at C:\Program Files\PerpleX\datafiles
    - edit the MakePerplexFolder.vbs script to copy different files to the
      directory it creates

If you are not sure what this whole Perplex thing is all about, try running
    through the "Getting Started" tutorial.
