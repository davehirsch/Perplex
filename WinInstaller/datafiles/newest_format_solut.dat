                             BEFORE FEB 2003 ALL PERPLEX SOLUTION MODELS
                             USED BRAGG-WILLIAM SITE FRACTIONS TO EXPRESS
                             EXCESS PROPERTIES AND CONFIGURATIONAL ENTROPY.
                             IN THE CURRENT VERSION THESE FRACTIONS ARE 
                             USED ONLY IN SOLUTION MODEL TYPE 1 (SEE BELOW).
                             FOR ALL OTHER MODEL TYPES BOTH EXCESS AND
                             CONFIGURATIONAL ENTROPY ARE NOW EXPRESSED IN
                             TERMS OF END-MEMBER FRACTIONS.
                      

                             Solution model type flags are:

                             0  - internal (fluid) EoS
                             1  - simple microscopic formulation (described in terms of bragg-williams fractions)
                             2  - simple macroscopic formulation (described in terms of endmember fractions)
                             6  - macroscopic formulation with speciation, 1 ordering parameter.
                             7  - macroscopic formulation reciprocal solution with dependent endmembers.

                             For non-ideal solutions, microscopic models assume Margules type excess functions; 
                             macroscopic models may be posed in terms of Margules (See model "Bio(HP)" for a commented
                             example) or Van Laar (e.g., Holland and Powell, CMP 2003; See model Fsp(C1) for a commented 
                             example) excess functions. The format of model type 1 is described in detail in the Perple_X 
                             program documentation (vdoc.pdf).
                           
                             The format for all other model types is not yet documented, but may be deduced from the commentary
                             within the models included herein. Character data is format free in all models except model type 1.
                             This means Vertex no longer expects data in specific columns. 

                             comments can be placed between models provided, nothing is written in the 
                             first 10 columns. Comments may be placed after
                             data if it is separated from the data by a '|' marker.

                             this file specify a restricted range for X(Mn), usually
                             from 0 to 20 mol % with 1 mol % increments. Refer to the

                             | and Sect 4 [READ 3] in vdoc.pdf) defines the geometric
                             | shape of the composition space, in this case a right triangular prism.
                             | the following lines list the endmembers that define the 6 vertices of 
                             | this prism. the geometry can be understood by noting that although 
                             | biotite as 3 mixing sites (refer to the occupancy table above), the
                             | site populations on all 3 sites are determined if the population on any
                             | 2 crystallographic sites. the independent "chemical" mixing sites need
                             | not correspond to the actual crystallographic sites, but in this case
                             | M2 and T2 can be identified as sites 1 and 2, respectively. Thus the
                             | species that mix on site 1 are Mg-Fe-Mn, and the species that mix on 
                             | site 2 are AlSi and AlAl. If the endmember with species i on site 1 and
                             | species j on site 2 is written as endmember ij, then the 6 endmembers will
                             | be read in the order: 11, 21, 31, 12, 22, 32
                             | if instead the binary site had been specified as site 1 and the ternary
                             | site as site 2, then the endmembers would be read in the order: 11, 21, 
                             | 12, 22, 13, 23.

mnbi     ann      phl        | endmember names (refer to the above comment, see also Sect 4 [Read 4] in    
mnts_i   sdph_i   east       | vdoc.pdf), by specifying mnbi as the endmember 11 (i.e., the first 
                             | endmember) the model implies that Mn is species 1 on site 1 (M2), and
                             | AlSi is species 1 on site 2 (T2, and, by default, AlAl must be species 2 
                             | on site 2). In this model, there is a remaining degree
                             | of freedom in that the second species on the first site may be chosen as
                             | either Fe or Mg. This degree of freedom is removed by specifying ann as
                             | endmember 21, implying Fe is species 2 on site 1 (M2, and, by default, Mg 
                             | must be species 3 on site 1). [Note that although sdph has Fe on M2 it could
                             | not be specified as the second endmember because it has species 2 (AlAl) on 
                             | site 2.] The order in which the 4 remaining species are entered is determined
                             | by these assignements, thus the third endmember (31) must have Mg on M2 and 
                             | AlSi on T2 (phl), the fourth endmember (12) must have Mn on M2 and AlAl on 
                             | T2 (mnts), etc. Users should be careful to order the endmembers so as to be 
                             | consistent with these considerations, because mistakes may not be detected 
                             | by vertex and can have dire consequences for computed solution properties. 

                             | ordered species:

                             | model types 6 and 8 require data defining the
                             | properties of an ordered "species". this species
                             | is defined as a stoichiometric combination of
                             | two independent endmembers and the enthalpy of
                             | formation of the ordered species from the
                             | these independent endmbers. the format for this
                             | data is

                             | name = num_1 * name_1 + num_2 * name_2 text = enthalpy

                             | where name is the arbitrary name of the ordered
                             | species, num_j is a number or fraction (i.e., two
                             | numbers separated by a '/') and name_j is the 
                             | name of a valid endmember. text is arbitrary and
                             | enthalpy is the enthalpy of formation of the ordered species.

                             | present in the thermodynamic data file.

                             | explain here (see Powell & Holland 2001), if an ordered

                             | then any dependent endmembers that can be defined in terms
                             | of this dependent endmember must be so defined. 
                             | i.e., here sdph_i must be defined in terms of obi, but
                             | the mnts_i endmember can only be written in termsn of

                             | Alternative subdivision shemes detailed in vdoc.pdf, may be useful for specialized
                             | applications, e.g., creating models with variable compositional resolution.

                             | By restricting the ranges specified in a model it is possible to focus pseudocompounds
                             | over a particular portion of a solutions composition space, such focusing can be 
                             | computationally advantageous when it is known a priori that only a limited range of
                             | compositions can be stable, but it should be undertaken with caution because the 
                             | results are not always easy to anticipate. 

                             | The primary difficulty in restricting compositional ranges is that the user 
                             | can explicitly control the composition of only c-1 compositions since the 
                             | cth composition is determined by difference. Additionally the subdivision ranges
                             | are applied sequentially, with compositions that violate mass balance (sum of
                             | compositions > 1) eliminated as they occur. Thus, in general, users have the greatest
                             | control on the composition of the first species on a site and no direct control
                             | on the composition of the last species. Since in most cases it is desired to 
                             | restrict the composition of dilute species, endmembers should be specified 
                             | (READ 4) so that the dilute species is not the last species.

                                      WARNING 1: This model can only be used for hydrous systems  
                                      if H2O is specified as a thermodynamic component or as a
                                      staurated component, it CANNOT be used if water is specified
                                      as a saturated phase component (i.e., if H2O is specified as a saturated 
                                      phase component, VERTEX will reject the H2OL endmember
                                      and the model will be applicable only to dry melts).

                                      WARNING 2: DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF THE FIRST 3 ENDMEMBERS
                                      this model uses an internal routine to compute the
                                      entropy of the melt that assumes the order entered
                                      here, see comments with endmember names below.

                                      WARNING 3: the endmembers q8L, fa8L, fo8L, and
                                      sil8L must be "made" in the thermodynamic data
                                      file. See the header section of hp02ver.dat for
                                      details on the "make" structure.

                                      WARNING 3.1: the (stabilizing) dqf corrections made
                                      to the fo8L, fa8L, and sil8L enedmembers make the

                                      these endmembers are present in high concentrations,
                                      to model such situations or to reproduce the published
                                      fo-fa-q or sil-q melting phase relations, the dqf corrections
                                      (below) should be set to zero. 


                                      WARNING 4: different versions of the HP data base
                                      may result in significant variations in the predicted
                                      position of the wet-solidus (Powell, pers comm.).


                                      WARNING 5: The melt model incorrectly predicts a high 
                                      pressure-low temperature stability field for water-silica
                                      rich melts. at 10 kb this field extends to ca 750 K and 
                                      at 3 kb to ca 550 K. For this reason the melt model should
                                      not be used at pressures far above 10 kb.

                                      
                                      WARNING 6: the subdivision ranges below may not
                                      span the entire range of validity for the solution

                                      Ghiorso et al (2002) G3 v. 3 (n. 5) model for mantle
                                      melting, 1-3 GPa. Read cautionary notes in Ghirso for
                                      applications beyond this pressure range. Calculations
                                      with this model can be sped up significantly by restricting
                                      the subdivsion ranges specified below.

                                      This is a reduced version of the pMELTS model that excludes
                                      the Cr-, Ni-, Co-, and P-bearing melt components. The melt
                                      endmember names have been changed from those used in the pMELTS paper.

                                      This model should be applied with solid phase data 
                                      and solution models from the MELTS program. The melt
                                      endmember data converted to PERPLE_X format is in the 
                                      file pMELTSver.dat. The PERPLE_X solid phase data files
                                      b92ver.dat and hp98ver.dat also include this data and therefore
                                      can be used with the pMELTS model, however using these files 
                                      will almost certainly result in inconsistencies with published
                                      pMELTS results.

                                      WARNING 1: This model can only be used for hydrous systems  
                                      if H2O is specified as a thermodynamic component
                                      (i.e., if H2O is specified as a saturated 
                                      component, VERTEX will reject the h2oG(L) endmember
                                      and the model will be applicable only to dry melts).

                                      WARNING 2: this model uses an internal routine to 
                                      compute the entropy of the melt that assumes 
                                      h2oG(l) is the first endmember.

                                      WARNING 3: the subdivision ranges below may not
                                      span the entire range of validity for the pMELT
                                      model. Check these ranges, and adjust them as 
                                      necessary before using this model.

                                      ====================================================
                                      Modified to use pure water at P and T standard
                                      state (the H2O endmember) as opposed to the h2oGL 
                                      endmember of Ghiorso et al. (2003), which so far 
                                      as I understand should  be equivalent. 

                                      NOTE: Use of H2O as an endmember requires the user
                                      specify an equation of state for H2O when running
                                      BUILD. To be strictly consistent with Ghiorso et al
                                      the Sterner and Pitzer EoS for water should be used 
                                      for this purpose, but it is not presently included
                                      in perplex. Instead of the Sterner-Pitzer EoS i would
                                      recommend using the CORK EoS, which differs negligibly
                                      from the Sterner-Pitzer EoS.

                             was written for Fe-free sapphirine). Eliminate site MB to reproduce 
                             the TJBH web page Thermocalc model.

                   AMPHIBOLE:         HP provide data that is principal adequate
                                      to model tr-ts-pg-gl amphibole as defined 
                                      in the table below, however the complete model
                                      may require too much computer memory to be feasible 
                                      for most users, so two subsystem models TrTsPg
                                      and GlTrTs are included in this file.

                                      Following HP it is assumed that M2 sites are 
                                      coupled to T1 sites. site multiplicity 
                                      of the T1 site is reduced to 2, this is 
                                      suggested by HP98 to account for charge 
                                      balance constraints. but doesn't make a lot
                                      of sense for the tr-parg mixing. assume
                                      Na on the A-site is coupled to Al on M2.

                                      the configurational entropy model has been
                                      constructed to take into account that Gasparik
                                      uses an X^2 molecular model for CaTs-Di and an
                                      X molecular model for Jd-Di. This implies that
                                      there is no disorder associated with placing Na
                                      on M2 (i.e., it is associated with Al on M1), 
                                      whereas Al on M1 is not assocated with Al on T.
                                      To get Gasparik's molecular formulation it is
                                      necessary to specify that Al mixes on only one
                                      of the two T-sites.

                             Van Laar Versions. The model as published is basically
                             bogus, HP fans should wait for the publication of a 
                             revised version.

                             USE THIS MODEL WITH EXTREME CAUTION (AND DON'T USE THE 
                             MODEL IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
                             WARNING):

                             The model has the following difficulties for the Ab-An
                             binary and they undoubtedly cause problems in the ternary:

                             1) The I1/C1 models are not (and cannot be used to) predict
                                the stable structural state, the I1 model is always more
                                stable than the C1; thus the "stable" state is supposed
                                to be chosen by assuming the C1 model is valid at 
                                X(Ab) > 1 - (0.12+0.00038*TK).

                             2) The model assigns a large positive interaction term for
                                I1 plagioclase, as a result the I1 model gives a solvus
                                that closes at ~ 910 K. At temperatures below the critical
                                temperature plagioclases in vicinity of the prescribed
                                I1/C1 transition (as defined in 1, above), that in principle 
                                is supposed to be stable, is metastable with respect to 
                                a mixture of I1 and C1 plagioclase.

                             reformatted and compositional ranges chosen given the following
                             considerations (JADC 12/03):
                                
                             * On the Ab-An join C1 is not stable below ~ 800 K,
                               and has X(An) < 0.4 and I1 is not stable for 
                               X(An) < 0.6 

                             * On the Ab-Or join C1 is always stable, with critical
                               composition X(Ab) ~ 0.34
                        
                             * The above considerations suggest the I1 model could be effectively represented
                               by a binary An-Ab (with X(Ab)>0.2) model; and the C1 model
                               should be split into a model with X(ab) < 0.33 with 
                               extensive ternary solution; and a model with X(Ab) > 0.33
                               with very limited ternary solution. Assuming these relationships
                               are valid the ternary feldspar phase relations are well 
                               represented by three solutions models

                               AbFsp(C1) and OrFsp(C1) - represent Ab-rich ternary feldspar
                               and Or-rich essentially binary (Ab-Or) feldspar, all with the
                               C1 structural state

                               Pl(I1) - represents essentially binary (Ab-An) anorthite
                               rich I1 structural state feldspar. 

                               A negative consequence of using AbFsp(C1) and OrFsp(C1) to
                               represent supercritical feldspar is the models produce 
                               a mock "solvus" where the compositional ranges abut.

                             | on each "chemical" mixing site of the solution (Sect 4 [READ 6] vdoc.pdf).
                             | for each site the compositional "range" of c-1 species (c is the number of 
                             | species on the site as defined in READ 3) is specified as well as a scheme 
                             | for interpreting the range. each range is defined by 3 numbers XMIN, XMAX, 
                             | and XINC, and the scheme is specified by an integer (IMD) written after the 
                             | c-1 ranges. The simplest scheme is cartesian, in which case IMD = 0 and the
                             | the XMIN, XMAX, and XINC indicate the range of compositions (from XMIN to XMAX) 
                             | of the respective c-1 species and the compositional spacing (XINC) of the 
                             | pseudocompounds. As entered above, the subdivision scheme will generate 
                             | pseudocompounds with X(Mn) on site 1 from 0 to 0.20 mol at 0.01 mol increments
                             | for each X(Mn) isopleth, compounds will be generated with X(Fe) from 0 to 1-X(Mn),
                             | where "0" and "1" correspond to XMIN and XMAX in the range for the second species
                             | on site 1, and X(Mg) = 1 - X(Fe) - X(Mn).

                             | Alternative subdivision shemes detailed in vdoc.pdf, may be useful for specialized
                             | applications, e.g., creating models with variable compositional resolution.

                             | By restricting the ranges specified in a model it is possible to focus pseudocompounds
                             | over a particular portion of a solutions composition space, such focusing can be 
                             | computationally advantageous when it is known a priori that only a limited range of
                             | compositions can be stable, but it should be undertaken with caution because the 
                             | results are not always easy to anticipate. 

                             | The primary difficulty in restricting compositional ranges is that the user 
                             | can explicitly control the composition of only c-1 compositions since the 
                             | cth composition is determined by difference. Additionally the subdivision ranges
                             | are applied sequentially, with compositions that violate mass balance (sum of
                             | compositions > 1) eliminated as they occur. Thus, in general, users have the greatest
                             | control on the composition of the first species on a site and no direct control
                             | on the composition of the last species. Since in most cases it is desired to 
                             | restrict the composition of dilute species, endmembers should be specified 
                             | (READ 4) so that the dilute species is not the last species.

                             This model allows Tschermaks substitution in both the Na
                             and Ca mica subsytems. I suspect that in many cases
                             such substitutions are insignificant, in which case
                             use of the reduced version of the model Mica(CH2)  
                             is much more efficient.

                             This model will only work with perplex '06, it can be used 
                             in perplex '05 but the van laar assymmetry will be eliminated 
                             by deleting the van laar size parameters listed at the 
                             end of the model.

                                      i.e., compound formation only occurs for omph.
                                      This model should only be used in conjunction with 
                                      Cpx(HP). The value of wdh appears discrepant 
                                      with the value in HP '98.

                                      The interaction parameters here are from the
                                      Omphacite model distributed with the '00

                                      NOTE: this model does not require Mg/(Fe+Mg)
                                      is the same across sites (as done in Thermocalc).
