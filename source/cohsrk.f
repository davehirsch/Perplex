c COHSRK is a fortran program to call various subroutines to calculate  
c C-O-H-S fluid speciation as a function of X(O), X(CO2), X(S), X(C) 
c a(C), f(S2), f(O2) or O2-S2-buffer assemblage. 

c The variables X(O), X(S), and X(C) are defined as:

c  X(O) = n(O)/{n(O)+n(H)}
c  X(S) = n(S)/{n(S)+n(C)}
c  X(C) = n(C)/{n(S)+n(C)+n(O)+n(H)}

c where n(C), n(S), n(O) and n(H)  are the total number of moles of 
c carbon, sulfur, oxygen and hydrogen (as opposed to the amounts
c of the species) in the fluid.

c The user may choose from the following routines, identified by
c number:

c    0 - Modified Redlich-Kwong (MRK)
c    1 - Kerrick & Jacobs 1981 hard sphere MRK (HSMRK)
c    2 - Hybrid MRK/HSMRK
c    3 - Saxena & Fei 1987 pseudo-virial expansion
c    4 - Bottinga & Richet 1981 (CO2 RK)
c    5 - Holland & Powell 1990 (CORK)
c    6 - Hybrid Haar et al 1979/HSMRK (TRKMRK)
c    7 - Graphite buffered COH MRK fluid
c    8 - Graphite buffered COH hybrid-RK fluid
c    9 - Maximum X(H2O) GCOH fluid Cesare & Connolly 1993
c   10 - X(O) GCOH-fluid hybrid-MRK Connolly & Cesare 1993
c   11 - X(O) GCOH-fluid MRK Connolly and Cesare 1993
c   12 - X(O) GCOHS Connolly & Cesare 1993
c   13 - X(H) H2-H2O-hybrid
c   14 - hogbrd, don't use this if you dont know what it is.
c   15 - X(H) low T H2-H2O-hybrid
c   16 - X(O) H-O HSMRK/MRK hybrid
c   17 - X(O) H-O-S HSMRK/MRK hybrid
c   18 - Delany/HSMRK/MRK hybrid, for P > 10 kb
c   19 - X(O)-X(S) GCOHS Connolly & Cesare 1993
c   20 - X(O)-X(C) GCOHS Connolly & Cesare 1993
c   24 - f(O2)-N/C graphite saturated COHN MRK fluid

c Routines 0-3, 5-6, and 18 are for conventional P-T-X(CO2) 
c calculations, where X(CO2) is the mole fraction of CO2 in 
c a binary H2O-CO2 mixture. The Saxena & Fei routine was
c programmed by someone else, and I suspect it has been 
c entered incorrectly. 

c Routine 4 is for pure CO2 fluids.

c Routines 7 and 8 are for C-O-H fluids as a function of 
c P-T and f(O2) or f(O2)-buffer at specified 
c graphite activity (usually 1). I recommend choice 8.

c Routine 9 returns the fugacities of O2, H2O, and CO2
c for a H:O = 2 graphite saturated C-O-H fluid, i.e.,
c the fugacities computed with routine 10 at X(O) = 1/3
c and a(graphite) = 1.

c Routines 10 and 11 are for C-O-H fluids as a function 
c of X(O) at specified graphite activity. I recommend 10.

c Routines 12 and 17 are for C-O-H-S and H-O-S fluids as
c a function of P-T-X(O) conditions at specified sulfur
c fugacity or buffer, for C-O-H-S fluids graphite activity
c must also be specified. 

c Routines 13 and 15 are for binary H2/H2O mixtures 
c (effectively H-O fluids at X(O) < 1/3), routine 15 uses
c parameters optimized for the solvus region.

c Routine 16 is for H-O fluids as a function of P-T-X(O).

c Routines 2, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 17 are a hybrids of the 
c HSMRK EoS (Kerrick & Jacobs) and the MRK (Redlich & Kwong/
c DeSantis et al/Holloway) EoS as described by Connolly & 
c Cesare, J Met Geol, 11:379-388, and for most purposes I would
c recommend these equations.

c Routine 19 calculates C-O-H-S graphite-UNDERSATURATED fluid 
c properties as a function of X(O) and the atomic S/C ratio 
c (expressed by the variable X(S)) at specified sulfur fugacity. 
c This routine often may not converge. The EoS is identical to
c that used in Routine 12.

c Routine 20 calculates C-O-H-S graphite-UNDERSATURATED fluid 
c properties as a function of X(O) and the atomic fraction of
c carbon in the fluid (X(C)) at specified sulfur fugacity.
c This routine can be made to calculate simple COH fluid 
c speciation as a function of bulk composition by setting 
c sulfur fugacity to such a low value that the concentration of 
c sulfur becomes negligible.
c This routine often may not converge. The EoS is identical to
c that used in Routine 12.

c Routine 24 calculates C-O-H-N graphite saturated fluid properties
c as a function of f(O2) and the fluid N/C ratio using a modified
c Redlich-Kwong EoS. The routine will fail in the limits x(H2O)->0
c and N/C->0.

c COHSRK is primarily intended to provide an example of how the
c various speciation routines in PERPLEX can be called. If you
c can follow the logic of the program then you shall probably be
c able to customize the program to use input, and generate output,
c more in line with your specific needs. I do have another program
c that generates a plot file with various species, concentrations,
c and fugacities plotted against X(O), and I shall be happy to 
c provide it to interested users.

c----------------------------------------------------------------------

c Limitations/warnings:

c The C-O-H-S and H-O-S routines do not consider the species C2H6,
c O2, and SO3 and pure S species, these will not be significant at
c the conditions realized in crustal metamorphic environments. 
c It is relatively easy to incorporate new species in the routines
c so if you suspect the species are important, please contact me
c and I will add the species.

c The HSMRK equation of state for water seems unreliable at P > 
c 15 Kbar, and hence all the hybrid EoS speciation routines
c as well. This has not bothered me because I am mostly concerned  
c with crustal metamorphic conditions; however, should you wish
c to make calculations at high pressure you need only replace the
c calls which get pure fluid fugacities with calls to the high
c pressure routine of your choice (e.g., DeSantis-Holloway MRK,
c Delany & Helgeson, Bottinga & Richet, etc. etc.).

c Functions for equilibrium constants are fit in the range 400-1400K.

c No warnings are issued if P-T-X(O) conditions are within a solvus.

c All X(O) routines fail at X(O) = 0 or 1, to avoid this problem
c the routines reset extreme values of X(O) to 1d-10 or 0.9999999999
c as appropriate.

c All X(O) routines may fail at X(O) = 1/3 if the fluid becomes an
c essentially mono-species H2O fluid, this is most likely to occur
c in simple H-O fluids.

c The C-O-H-S and H-O-S routines permit calculations for a fluid
c in equilibrium with pyrrhotite with a fixed atomic Fe/S ratio,
c this is not the same as N(FeS), the mole fraction of troilite
c relative to S2, as often reported for pyrrhotite analyses.

c Routines 19 and 20 may not converge, or may converge to 
c invalid roots, in the vicinity of graphite saturated and
c supersaturated conditions; and at very carbon under-saturated 
c conditions numerical slop may lead to errors on the order of
c 0.4 log units in calculated properties such as f(O2).

c In speciation routines, if the concentration of a species becomes 
c negligible (as determined by the numerical precision of the
c computer being used), its properties may be undefined or
c may have meaningless fluctuations.
c----------------------------------------------------------------------

c NOTES ON THIS SOURCE AND COMPILING:

c The MAIN program COHSRK and a BLOCK DATA are included in this file,
c all the subroutines called by COHSRK are in the file flib.f.
c The files may be compiled separately and the objects linked together,
c or you may concatenate the two files. 

c This program was put together from routines used in PERPLEX (see
c below) and for this reason it is not as compact or as flexible
c as might be desired. The size of the flib.f may cause problems
c for DOS compilers, these can be overcome by splitting the source
c into two or three blocks that can then be combined during linking.
c Alternatively, routines that are not considered may be useful
c can be eliminated if the calls to these routines from subprogram
c cfluid are also eliminated.

c Specifically I would recommend eliminating:

c      subroutine brmrk
c      subroutine simps 
c      subroutine qromb 
c      subroutine polint 
c      subroutine trapzd 
c      function brvol 
c      function vdpdv 
c      subroutine hosrk5 
c      subroutine cohfit 
c      subroutine haar
c      subroutine psat2
c      subroutine aideal 
c      subroutine trkmrk
c      subroutine saxfei
c      subroutine hprk
c      subroutine cohgra 
c      subroutine hh2ork 
c      subroutine lohork
c      subroutine lomrk 

c this requires elimination of the calls to: brmrk, cohfit,
c trkmrk, saxfei, hprk, cohgra, hh2ork, and lohork from cfluid.

c subroutines warn and error can also be eliminated if the 
c calls to these routines, from subroutines rfluid, brmrk,
c cohgra, cohsgr and cohhyb, are replaced by statements that write 
c an appropriate warning or error message.

c I/O: most input and output is done through the common blocks below,
c the significance of the variables as named in the main program is:

c ifug   - number indexing the requested EoS.
c p      - pressure, bars.
c t      - temperature, kelvins.
c xo     - X(O) for multispecies routines, and X(CO2) or X(H2) for
c          binary routines.
c vol    - molar volume for all multispecies routines, and binary
c          routines 0, 1, 13, 15.
c fh2o   - natural log (f(H2O)) for all routines.
c fco2   - natural log of the species other than H2O (i.e., CO2 or H2)
c          in all binary routines.
c fo2    - natural log (f(O2)).
c fs2    - 1/2 natural log (f(S2)).

c the following variables are only used for multispecies calculations:

c ins(i) - pointers indicating the species are to be calculated.
c isp    - number of species to be calculated.
c nsp    - dimensioning for the maximum number of species. 
c ibuf   - pointer indicating method of calculating f(O2) for
c          routines 7 and 8, or f(S2) for routines 12 and 17.
c dlnfo2 - for routines 7 and 8 the displacement of the f(O2)
c          relative to a buffer (in log units) or the absolute
c          ln(f(O2)) (if ibuf = 3). For routines 12 and 17,
c          if ibuf = 2 then dlnfo2 is the atomic Fe/S of pyrrhotite,
c          if ibuf = 3 then dlnfo2 is 1/2 the natural log (f(S2)). 
c elag   - natural log of graphite activity.
c g(i)   - fugacity coefficient of the ith species.
c x(i)   - mole fraction of the ith species.

c the indices of eleven species presently defined are:

c         1 = H2O
c         2 = CO2
c         3 = CO
c         4 = CH4 
c         5 = H2
c         6 = H2S
c         7 = O2
c         8 = SO2
c         9 = COS
c        10 = N2
c        11 = NH3

c O2 should be replaced by SO3, and ethane should be added.
